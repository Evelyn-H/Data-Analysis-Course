What says Polonius?\\n\\nPol.\\nHe hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\\nBy laboursome petition; and at last\\nUpon his will I seal'd my hard consent:\\nI do beseech you, give him leave to go.\\n\\nKing.\\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,\\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will!--\\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son--\\n\\nHam.\\n[Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind!\\n\\nKing.\\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\\n\\nHam.\\nNot so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.\\n\\nQueen.\\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,\\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\\nDo not for ever with thy vailed lids\\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust:\\nThou know'st 'tis common,--all that lives must die,\\nPassing through nature to eternity.\\n\\nHam.\\nAy, madam, it is common.\\n\\nQueen.\\nIf it be,\\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\\n\\nHam.\\nSeems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.\\n'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\\nNor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,\\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\\nNor the dejected 'havior of the visage,\\nTogether with all forms, moods, shows of grief,\\nThat can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;\\nFor they are actions that a man might play;\\nBut I have that within which passeth show;\\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\\n\\nKing.\\n'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,\\nTo give these mourning duties to your father;\\nBut, you must know, your father lost a father;\\nThat father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,\\nIn filial obligation, for some term\\nTo do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere\\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\\nOf impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;\\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven;\\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient;\\nAn understanding simple and unschool'd;\\nFor what we know must be, and is as common\\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\\nWhy should we, in our peevish opposition,\\nTake it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,\\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\\nTo reason most absurd; whose common theme\\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\\nFrom the first corse till he that died to-day,\\n'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth\\nThis unprevailing woe; and think of us\\nAs of a father: for let the world take note\\nYou are the most immediate to our throne;\\nAnd with no less nobility of love\\nThan that which dearest father bears his son\\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\\nIt is most retrograde to our desire:\\nAnd we beseech you bend you to remain\\nHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\\n\\nQueen.\\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:\\nI pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.\\n\\nHam.\\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\\n\\nKing.\\nWhy, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:\\nBe as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come;\\nThis gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet\\nSits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,\\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day\\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;\\nAnd the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,\\nRe-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.\\n\\n[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]\\n\\nHam.\\nO that this too too solid flesh would melt,\\nThaw, and resolve itself into a dew!\\nOr that the Everlasting had not fix'd\\nHis canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!\\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\\nFie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,\\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\\nBut two months dead!--nay, not so much, not two:\\nSo excellent a king; that was, to this,\\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,\\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\\nBy what it fed on: and yet, within a month,--\\nLet me not think on't,--Frailty, thy name is woman!--\\nA little month; or ere those shoes were old\\nWith which she followed my poor father's body\\nLike Niobe, all tears;--why she, even she,--\\nO God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,\\nWould have mourn'd longer,--married with mine uncle,\\nMy father's brother; but no more like my father\\nThan I to Hercules: within a month;\\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\\nShe married:-- O, most wicked speed, to post\\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good;\\nBut break my heart,--for I must hold my tongue!\\n\\n[Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]\\n\\nHor.\\nHail to your lordship!\\n\\nHam.\\nI am glad to see you well:\\nHoratio,--or I do forget myself.\\n\\nHor.\\nThe same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.\\n\\nHam.\\nSir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:\\nAnd what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--\\nMarcellus?\\n\\nMar.\\nMy good lord,--\\n\\nHam.\\nI am very glad to see you.--Good even, sir.--\\nBut what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\\n\\nHor.\\nA truant disposition, good my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nI would not hear your enemy say so;\\nNor shall you do my ear that violence,\\nTo make it truster of your own report\\nAgainst yourself: I know you are no truant.\\nBut what is your affair in Elsinore?\\nWe'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\\n\\nHor.\\nMy lord, I came to see your father's funeral.\\n\\nHam.\\nI prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.\\nI think it was to see my mother's wedding.\\n\\nHor.\\nIndeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.\\n\\nHam.\\nThrift, thrift, Horatio!

A figure like your father,\\nArmed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,\\nAppears before them and with solemn march\\nGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd\\nBy their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,\\nWithin his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd\\nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,\\nStand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me\\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did;\\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch:\\nWhere, as they had deliver'd, both in time,\\nForm of the thing, each word made true and good,\\nThe apparition comes: I knew your father;\\nThese hands are not more like.\\n\\nHam.\\nBut where was this?\\n\\nMar.\\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.\\n\\nHam.\\nDid you not speak to it?\\n\\nHor.\\nMy lord, I did;\\nBut answer made it none: yet once methought\\nIt lifted up it head, and did address\\nItself to motion, like as it would speak:\\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\\nAnd vanish'd from our sight.\\n\\nHam.\\n'Tis very strange.\\n\\nHor.\\nAs I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;\\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\\nTo let you know of it.\\n\\nHam.\\nIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\\nHold you the watch to-night?\\n\\nMar. and Ber.\\nWe do, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nArm'd, say you?\\n\\nBoth.\\nArm'd, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nFrom top to toe?\\n\\nBoth.\\nMy lord, from head to foot.\\n\\nHam.\\nThen saw you not his face?\\n\\nHor.\\nO, yes, my lord: he wore his beaver up.\\n\\nHam.\\nWhat, look'd he frowningly?\\n\\nHor.\\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\\n\\nHam.\\nPale or red?\\n\\nHor.\\nNay, very pale.\\n\\nHam.\\nAnd fix'd his eyes upon you?\\n\\nHor.\\nMost constantly.\\n\\nHam.\\nI would I had been there.\\n\\nHor.\\nIt would have much amaz'd you.\\n\\nHam.\\nVery like, very like.

A room in Polonius's house.\\n\\n[Enter Laertes and Ophelia.]\\n\\nLaer.\\nMy necessaries are embark'd: farewell:\\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\\nAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,\\nBut let me hear from you.\\n\\nOph.\\nDo you doubt that?\\n\\nLaer.\\nFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,\\nHold it a fashion, and a toy in blood:\\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;\\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute;\\nNo more.\\n\\nOph.\\nNo more but so?\\n\\nLaer.\\nThink it no more:\\nFor nature, crescent, does not grow alone\\nIn thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,\\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now;\\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\\nThe virtue of his will: but you must fear,\\nHis greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;\\nFor he himself is subject to his birth:\\nHe may not, as unvalu'd persons do,\\nCarve for himself; for on his choice depends\\nThe safety and health of this whole state;\\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd\\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\\nWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\\nAs he in his particular act and place\\nMay give his saying deed; which is no further\\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\\nThen weigh what loss your honour may sustain\\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\\nTo his unmaster'd importunity.\\nFear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;\\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon:\\nVirtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:\\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\\nToo oft before their buttons be disclos'd:\\nAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth\\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\\nBe wary then; best safety lies in fear:\\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\\n\\nOph.\\nI shall th' effect of this good lesson keep\\nAs watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,\\nDo not, as some ungracious pastors do,\\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven;\\nWhilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,\\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads\\nAnd recks not his own read.\\n\\nLaer.\\nO, fear me not.\\nI stay too long:--but here my father comes.\\n\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\n\\nA double blessing is a double grace;\\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\\n\\nPol.\\nYet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!\\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\\nAnd you are stay'd for.

Tender yourself more dearly;\\nOr,--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\\nWronging it thus,--you'll tender me a fool.\\n\\nOph.\\nMy lord, he hath importun'd me with love\\nIn honourable fashion.\\n\\nPol.\\nAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\\n\\nOph.\\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\\n\\nPol.\\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\\nLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,\\nGiving more light than heat,--extinct in both,\\nEven in their promise, as it is a-making,--\\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence;\\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\\nThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\\nBelieve so much in him, that he is young;\\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\\nThan may be given you: in few, Ophelia,\\nDo not believe his vows; for they are brokers,--\\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\\nThe better to beguile. This is for all,--\\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\\nLook to't, I charge you; come your ways.\\n\\nOph.\\nI shall obey, my lord.\\n\\n[Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\nScene IV.

I'll speak to him again.--What do you\\nread, my lord?\\n\\nHam.\\nWords, words, words.\\n\\nPol.\\nWhat is the matter, my lord?\\n\\nHam.\\nBetween who?\\n\\nPol.\\nI mean, the matter that you read, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nSlanders, sir: for the satirical slave says here that old men\\nhave grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes\\npurging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a\\nplentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which,\\nsir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it\\nnot honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,\\nshould be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.\\n\\nPol.\\n[Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.--\\nWill you walk out of the air, my lord?\\n\\nHam.\\nInto my grave?\\n\\nPol.\\nIndeed, that is out o' the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes\\nhis replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which\\nreason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I\\nwill leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between\\nhim and my daughter.--My honourable lord, I will most humbly take\\nmy leave of you.\\n\\nHam.\\nYou cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more\\nwillingly part withal,--except my life, except my life, except my\\nlife.\\n\\nPol.\\nFare you well, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nThese tedious old fools!\\n\\n[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\\n\\nPol.\\nYou go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.\\n\\nRos.\\n[To Polonius.] God save you, sir!\\n\\n[Exit Polonius.]\\n\\nGuil.\\nMy honoured lord!\\n\\nRos.\\nMy most dear lord!\\n\\nHam.\\nMy excellent good friends!

Good lads, how do ye both?\\n\\nRos.\\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\\n\\nGuil.\\nHappy in that we are not over-happy;\\nOn fortune's cap we are not the very button.\\n\\nHam.\\nNor the soles of her shoe?\\n\\nRos.\\nNeither, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nThen you live about her waist, or in the middle of her\\nfavours?\\n\\nGuil.\\nFaith, her privates we.\\n\\nHam.\\nIn the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a\\nstrumpet. What's the news?\\n\\nRos.\\nNone, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.\\n\\nHam.\\nThen is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me\\nquestion more in particular: what have you, my good friends,\\ndeserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison\\nhither?\\n\\nGuil.\\nPrison, my lord!\\n\\nHam.\\nDenmark's a prison.\\n\\nRos.\\nThen is the world one.\\n\\nHam.\\nA goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and\\ndungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.\\n\\nRos.\\nWe think not so, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nWhy, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good\\nor bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.\\n\\nRos.\\nWhy, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your\\nmind.\\n\\nHam.\\nO God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a\\nking of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\\n\\nGuil.\\nWhich dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of\\nthe ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\\n\\nHam.\\nA dream itself is but a shadow.\\n\\nRos.\\nTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that\\nit is but a shadow's shadow.\\n\\nHam.\\nThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd\\nheroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my\\nfay, I cannot reason.\\n\\nRos. and Guild.\\nWe'll wait upon you.\\n\\nHam.\\nNo such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my\\nservants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most\\ndreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what\\nmake you at Elsinore?\\n\\nRos.\\nTo visit you, my lord; no other occasion.\\n\\nHam.\\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:\\nand sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were\\nyou not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free\\nvisitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.\\n\\nGuil.\\nWhat should we say, my lord?\\n\\nHam.\\nWhy, anything--but to the purpose. You were sent for; and\\nthere is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties\\nhave not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen\\nhave sent for you.\\n\\nRos.\\nTo what end, my lord?\\n\\nHam.\\nThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights\\nof our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the\\nobligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a\\nbetter proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with\\nme, whether you were sent for or no.\\n\\nRos.\\n[To Guildenstern.] What say you?\\n\\nHam.\\n[Aside.] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you love me, hold\\nnot off.\\n\\nGuil.\\nMy lord, we were sent for.\\n\\nHam.\\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your\\ndiscovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no\\nfeather. I have of late,--but wherefore I know not,--lost all my\\nmirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so\\nheavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,\\nseems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the\\nair, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical\\nroof fretted with golden fire,--why, it appears no other thing\\nto me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a\\npiece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in\\nfaculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in\\naction how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the\\nbeauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what\\nis this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman\\nneither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.\\n\\nRos.\\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\\n\\nHam.\\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?\\n\\nRos.\\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten\\nentertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them\\non the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.\\n\\nHam.\\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome,--his majesty shall\\nhave tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and\\ntarget; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall\\nend his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose\\nlungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind\\nfreely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are\\nthey?\\n\\nRos.\\nEven those you were wont to take such delight in,--the\\ntragedians of the city.\\n\\nHam.\\nHow chances it they travel? their residence, both in\\nreputation and profit, was better both ways.\\n\\nRos.\\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the late\\ninnovation.\\n\\nHam.\\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the\\ncity? Are they so followed?\\n\\nRos.\\nNo, indeed, are they not.\\n\\nHam.\\nHow comes it? do they grow rusty?\\n\\nRos.\\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,\\nsir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top\\nof question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are\\nnow the fashion; and so berattle the common stages,--so they call\\nthem,--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and\\ndare scarce come thither.\\n\\nHam.\\nWhat, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they\\nescoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can\\nsing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow\\nthemselves to common players,--as it is most like, if their means\\nare no better,--their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim\\nagainst their own succession?\\n\\nRos.\\nFaith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation\\nholds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for\\nawhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player\\nwent to cuffs in the question.\\n\\nHam.\\nIs't possible?\\n\\nGuil.\\nO, there has been much throwing about of brains.\\n\\nHam.\\nDo the boys carry it away?\\n\\nRos.\\nAy, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.\\n\\nHam.\\nIt is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and\\nthose that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give\\ntwenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in\\nlittle. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if\\nphilosophy could find it out.\\n\\n[Flourish of trumpets within.]\\n\\nGuil.\\nThere are the players.\\n\\nHam.\\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come: the\\nappurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply\\nwith you in this garb; lest my extent to the players, which I\\ntell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like\\nentertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father\\nand aunt-mother are deceived.\\n\\nGuil.\\nIn what, my dear lord?\\n\\nHam.\\nI am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I\\nknow a hawk from a handsaw.\\n\\n[Enter Polonius.]\\n\\nPol.\\nWell be with you, gentlemen!\\n\\nHam.\\nHark you, Guildenstern;--and you too;--at each ear a hearer: that\\ngreat baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.\\n\\nRos.\\nHappily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old\\nman is twice a child.\\n\\nHam.\\nI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.--You\\nsay right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.\\n\\nPol.\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\\n\\nHam.\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in\\nRome,--\\n\\nPol.\\nThe actors are come hither, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nBuzz, buzz!\\n\\nPol.\\nUpon my honour,--\\n\\nHam.\\nThen came each actor on his ass,--\\n\\nPol.\\nThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,\\nhistory, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,\\ntragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene\\nindividable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor\\nPlautus too light.

Thy face is\\nvalanc'd since I saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in\\nDenmark?--What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your\\nladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the\\naltitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of\\nuncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.--Masters, you are\\nall welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at\\nanything we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a\\ntaste of your quality: come, a passionate speech.\\n\\nI Play.\\nWhat speech, my lord?\\n\\nHam.\\nI heard thee speak me a speech once,--but it was never acted;\\nor if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased\\nnot the million, 'twas caviare to the general; but it was,--as I\\nreceived it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in\\nthe top of mine,--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,\\nset down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said\\nthere were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,\\nnor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of\\naffectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as\\nsweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it\\nI chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it\\nespecially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in\\nyour memory, begin at this line;--let me see, let me see:--\\n\\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,--\\n\\nit is not so:-- it begins with Pyrrhus:--\\n\\n  'The rugged Pyrrhus,--he whose sable arms,\\n   Black as his purpose, did the night resemble\\n   When he lay couched in the ominous horse,--\\n   Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\\n   With heraldry more dismal; head to foot\\n   Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd\\n   With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\\n   Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,\\n   That lend a tyrannous and a damned light\\n   To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,\\n   And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,\\n   With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\n   Old grandsire Priam seeks.'\\n\\nSo, proceed you.\\n\\nPol.\\n'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good\\ndiscretion.\\n\\nI Play.\\n   Anon he finds him,\\n   Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,\\n   Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\\n   Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,\\n   Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;\\n   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\\n   The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\\n   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\\n   Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash\\n   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,\\n   Which was declining on the milky head\\n   Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:\\n   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;\\n   And, like a neutral to his will and matter,\\n   Did nothing.\\n   But as we often see, against some storm,\\n   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\\n   The bold winds speechless, and the orb below\\n   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\\n   Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\\n   A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;\\n   And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\\n   On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,\\n   With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\\n   Now falls on Priam.--\\n   Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,\\n   In general synod, take away her power;\\n   Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\\n   And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\\n   As low as to the fiends!\\n\\nPol.\\nThis is too long.\\n\\nHam.\\nIt shall to the barber's, with your beard.--Pr'ythee say on.--\\nHe's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps:--say on; come\\nto Hecuba.\\n\\nI Play.\\n   But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,--\\n\\nHam.\\n'The mobled queen'?\\n\\nPol.\\nThat's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.\\n\\nI Play.\\n   Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames\\n   With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head\\n   Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\\n   About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,\\n   A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;--\\n   Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,\\n   'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:\\n   But if the gods themselves did see her then,\\n   When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\n   In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\\n   The instant burst of clamour that she made,--\\n   Unless things mortal move them not at all,--\\n   Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\\n   And passion in the gods.\\n\\nPol.\\nLook, whether he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's\\neyes.--Pray you, no more!\\n\\nHam.\\n'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.--\\nGood my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you\\nhear? Let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief\\nchronicles of the time; after your death you were better have a\\nbad epitaph than their ill report while you live.\\n\\nPol.\\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\\n\\nHam.\\nOdd's bodikin, man, better: use every man after his\\ndesert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own\\nhonour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in\\nyour bounty. Take them in.\\n\\nPol.\\nCome, sirs.\\n\\nHam.\\nFollow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.\\n\\n[Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First.]\\n\\nDost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murder of\\nGonzago'?\\n\\nI Play.\\nAy, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nWe'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a\\nspeech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and\\ninsert in't? could you not?\\n\\nI Play.\\nAy, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nVery well.--Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.\\n\\n[Exit First Player.]\\n\\n--My good friends [to Ros. and Guild.], I'll leave you till\\nnight: you are welcome to Elsinore.\\n\\nRos.\\nGood my lord!\\n\\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\\n\\nHam.\\nAy, so, God b' wi' ye!\\nNow I am alone.\\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\\nThat from her working all his visage wan'd;\\nTears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,\\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\\nFor Hecuba?\\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech;\\nMake mad the guilty, and appal the free;\\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,\\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears.\\nYet I,\\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,\\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\\nAnd can say nothing; no, not for a king\\nUpon whose property and most dear life\\nA damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?\\nWho calls me villain? breaks my pate across?\\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\\nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat\\nAs deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?\\n'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\\nBut I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall\\nTo make oppression bitter; or ere this\\nI should have fatted all the region kites\\nWith this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!\\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\\nO, vengeance!\\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\\nThat I, the son of a dear father murder'd,\\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words\\nAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,\\nA scullion!\\nFie upon't! foh!--About, my brain! I have heard\\nThat guilty creatures, sitting at a play,\\nHave by the very cunning of the scene\\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\\nThey have proclaim'd their malefactions;\\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\\nWith most miraculous organ, I'll have these players\\nPlay something like the murder of my father\\nBefore mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;\\nI'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,\\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\\nMay be the devil: and the devil hath power\\nTo assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps\\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,--\\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,--\\nAbuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds\\nMore relative than this.--the play's the thing\\nWherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\\n\\n[Exit.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III.\\n\\nScene I.

To die,--to sleep;--\\nTo sleep! perchance to dream:--ay, there's the rub;\\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\\nMust give us pause: there's the respect\\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\\nThe oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\\nThe pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,\\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\\nWith a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,\\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\\nBut that the dread of something after death,--\\nThe undiscover'd country, from whose bourn\\nNo traveller returns,--puzzles the will,\\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all;\\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;\\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment,\\nWith this regard, their currents turn awry,\\nAnd lose the name of action.--Soft you now!\\nThe fair Ophelia!--Nymph, in thy orisons\\nBe all my sins remember'd.\\n\\nOph.\\nGood my lord,\\nHow does your honour for this many a day?\\n\\nHam.\\nI humbly thank you; well, well, well.\\n\\nOph.\\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\\nThat I have longed long to re-deliver.\\nI pray you, now receive them.\\n\\nHam.\\nNo, not I;\\nI never gave you aught.\\n\\nOph.\\nMy honour'd lord, you know right well you did;\\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath compos'd\\nAs made the things more rich; their perfume lost,\\nTake these again; for to the noble mind\\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\\nThere, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nHa, ha! are you honest?\\n\\nOph.\\nMy lord?\\n\\nHam.\\nAre you fair?\\n\\nOph.\\nWhat means your lordship?\\n\\nHam.\\nThat if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no\\ndiscourse to your beauty.\\n\\nOph.\\nCould beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?\\n\\nHam.\\nAy, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform\\nhonesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can\\ntranslate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox,\\nbut now the time gives it proof.

A hall in the Castle.\\n\\n[Enter Hamlet and certain Players.]\\n\\nHam.\\nSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,\\ntrippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your\\nplayers do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do\\nnot saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all\\ngently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,\\nwhirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a\\ntemperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the\\nsoul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to\\ntatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who,\\nfor the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb\\nshows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing\\nTermagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.\\n\\nI Player.\\nI warrant your honour.\\n\\nHam.\\nBe not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your\\ntutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with\\nthis special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of\\nnature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,\\nwhose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as\\n'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,\\nscorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his\\nform and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though\\nit make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious\\ngrieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,\\no'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I\\nhave seen play,--and heard others praise, and that highly,--not\\nto speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of\\nChristians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so\\nstrutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's\\njourneymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated\\nhumanity so abominably.\\n\\nI Player.\\nI hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.\\n\\nHam.\\nO, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns\\nspeak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them\\nthat will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren\\nspectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary\\nquestion of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous\\nand shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go\\nmake you ready.\\n\\n[Exeunt Players.]\\n\\n[Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]\\n\\nHow now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?\\n\\nPol.\\nAnd the queen too, and that presently.\\n\\nHam.\\nBid the players make haste.\\n\\n[Exit Polonius.]\\n\\nWill you two help to hasten them?\\n\\nRos. and Guil.\\nWe will, my lord.\\n\\n[Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]\\n\\nHam.\\nWhat, ho, Horatio!\\n\\n[Enter Horatio.]\\n\\nHor.\\nHere, sweet lord, at your service.\\n\\nHam.\\nHoratio, thou art e'en as just a man\\nAs e'er my conversation cop'd withal.\\n\\nHor.\\nO, my dear lord,--\\n\\nHam.\\nNay, do not think I flatter;\\nFor what advancement may I hope from thee,\\nThat no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,\\nTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?\\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;\\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\\nWhere thrift may follow fawning.

If he be now return'd--\\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\\nNo more to undertake it,--I will work him\\nTo exploit, now ripe in my device,\\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall:\\nAnd for his death no wind shall breathe;\\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\\nAnd call it accident.\\n\\nLaer.\\nMy lord, I will be rul'd;\\nThe rather if you could devise it so\\nThat I might be the organ.\\n\\nKing.\\nIt falls right.\\nYou have been talk'd of since your travel much,\\nAnd that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality\\nWherein they say you shine: your sum of parts\\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\\nAs did that one; and that, in my regard,\\nOf the unworthiest siege.\\n\\nLaer.\\nWhat part is that, my lord?\\n\\nKing.\\nA very riband in the cap of youth,\\nYet needful too; for youth no less becomes\\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\\nImporting health and graveness.--Two months since,\\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy,--\\nI've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,\\nAnd they can well on horseback: but this gallant\\nHad witchcraft in't: he grew unto his seat;\\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\\nAs had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd\\nWith the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought\\nThat I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,\\nCome short of what he did.\\n\\nLaer.\\nA Norman was't?\\n\\nKing.\\nA Norman.\\n\\nLaer.\\nUpon my life, Lamond.\\n\\nKing.\\nThe very same.\\n\\nLaer.\\nI know him well: he is the brooch indeed\\nAnd gem of all the nation.\\n\\nKing.\\nHe made confession of you;\\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\\nFor art and exercise in your defence,\\nAnd for your rapier most especially,\\nThat he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed\\nIf one could match you: the scrimers of their nation\\nHe swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\\nIf you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his\\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\\nYour sudden coming o'er, to play with him.\\nNow, out of this,--\\n\\nLaer.\\nWhat out of this, my lord?\\n\\nKing.\\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\\nA face without a heart?\\n\\nLaer.\\nWhy ask you this?\\n\\nKing.\\nNot that I think you did not love your father;\\nBut that I know love is begun by time,\\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\\nThere lives within the very flame of love\\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still;\\nFor goodness, growing to a plurisy,\\nDies in his own too much: that we would do,\\nWe should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,\\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\\nAnd then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,\\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer:--\\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake\\nTo show yourself your father's son in deed\\nMore than in words?\\n\\nLaer.\\nTo cut his throat i' the church.\\n\\nKing.\\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\\nRevenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,\\nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.\\nHamlet return'd shall know you are come home:\\nWe'll put on those shall praise your excellence\\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\\nThe Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together\\nAnd wager on your heads: he, being remiss,\\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\\nWill not peruse the foils; so that with ease,\\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\\nA sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,\\nRequite him for your father.\\n\\nLaer.\\nI will do't:\\nAnd for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.\\nI bought an unction of a mountebank,\\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\\nThis is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point\\nWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,\\nIt may be death.\\n\\nKing.\\nLet's further think of this;\\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\\nMay fit us to our shape: if this should fail,\\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance.\\n'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project\\nShould have a back or second, that might hold\\nIf this did blast in proof.

For here lies\\nthe point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an\\nact hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:\\nargal, she drowned herself wittingly.\\n\\n2 Clown.\\nNay, but hear you, goodman delver,--\\n\\n1 Clown.\\nGive me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the\\nman; good: if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,\\nwill he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that: but if the water come\\nto him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is\\nnot guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.\\n\\n2 Clown.\\nBut is this law?\\n\\n1 Clown.\\nAy, marry, is't--crowner's quest law.\\n\\n2 Clown.\\nWill you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a\\ngentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.\\n\\n1 Clown.\\nWhy, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk\\nshould have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves\\nmore than their even Christian.--Come, my spade.

Sir, here\\nis newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute\\ngentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft\\nsociety and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he\\nis the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the\\ncontinent of what part a gentleman would see.\\n\\nHam.\\nSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;--though, I\\nknow, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of\\nmemory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.\\nBut, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great\\narticle, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make\\ntrue diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else\\nwould trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.\\n\\nOsr.\\nYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\\n\\nHam.\\nThe concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more\\nrawer breath?\\n\\nOsr.\\nSir?\\n\\nHor.\\nIs't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,\\nsir, really.\\n\\nHam.\\nWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?\\n\\nOsr.\\nOf Laertes?\\n\\nHor.\\nHis purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.\\n\\nHam.\\nOf him, sir.\\n\\nOsr.\\nI know, you are not ignorant,--\\n\\nHam.\\nI would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not\\nmuch approve me.--Well, sir.\\n\\nOsr.\\nYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,--\\n\\nHam.\\nI dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in\\nexcellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.\\n\\nOsr.\\nI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on\\nhim by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.\\n\\nHam.\\nWhat's his weapon?\\n\\nOsr.\\nRapier and dagger.\\n\\nHam.\\nThat's two of his weapons:--but well.\\n\\nOsr.\\nThe king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:\\nagainst the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French\\nrapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and\\nso: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,\\nvery responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of\\nvery liberal conceit.\\n\\nHam.\\nWhat call you the carriages?\\n\\nHor.\\nI knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.\\n\\nOsr.\\nThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.\\n\\nHam.\\nThe phrase would be more german to the matter if we could\\ncarry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.\\nBut, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their\\nassigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that's the French\\nbet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?\\n\\nOsr.\\nThe king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between\\nyour and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath\\nlaid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial\\nif your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.\\n\\nHam.\\nHow if I answer no?\\n\\nOsr.\\nI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\\n\\nHam.\\nSir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,\\nit is the breathing time of day with me: let the foils be\\nbrought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,\\nI will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my\\nshame and the odd hits.\\n\\nOsr.\\nShall I re-deliver you e'en so?\\n\\nHam.\\nTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\\n\\nOsr.\\nI commend my duty to your lordship.\\n\\nHam.\\nYours, yours.\\n\\n[Exit Osric.]\\n\\nHe does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else\\nfor's turn.\\n\\nHor.\\nThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\\n\\nHam.\\nHe did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,--and\\nmany more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,--\\nonly got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;\\na kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and\\nthrough the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow\\nthem to their trial, the bubbles are out,\\n\\n[Enter a Lord.]\\n\\nLord.\\nMy lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,\\nwho brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends\\nto know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you\\nwill take longer time.\\n\\nHam.\\nI am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:\\nif his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided\\nI be so able as now.\\n\\nLord.\\nThe King and Queen and all are coming down.\\n\\nHam.\\nIn happy time.\\n\\nLord.\\nThe queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to\\nLaertes before you fall to play.\\n\\nHam.\\nShe well instructs me.\\n\\n[Exit Lord.]\\n\\nHor.\\nYou will lose this wager, my lord.\\n\\nHam.\\nI do not think so; since he went into France I have been in\\ncontinual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not\\nthink how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.\\n\\nHor.\\nNay, good my lord,--\\n\\nHam.\\nIt is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as\\nwould perhaps trouble a woman.\\n\\nHor.\\nIf your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will forestall their\\nrepair hither, and say you are not fit.\\n\\nHam.\\nNot a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in\\nthe fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be\\nnot to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:\\nthe readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves,\\nwhat is't to leave betimes?\\n\\n[Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with\\nfoils &c.]\\n\\nKing.\\nCome, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.\\n\\n[The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]\\n\\nHam.\\nGive me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong:\\nBut pardon't, as you are a gentleman.\\nThis presence knows, and you must needs have heard,\\nHow I am punish'd with sore distraction.\\nWhat I have done\\nThat might your nature, honour, and exception\\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\\nWas't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:\\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,\\nAnd when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,\\nThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\\nWho does it, then? His madness: if't be so,\\nHamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;\\nHis madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\\nSir, in this audience,\\nLet my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil\\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts\\nThat I have shot my arrow o'er the house\\nAnd hurt my brother.\\n\\nLaer.\\nI am satisfied in nature,\\nWhose motive, in this case, should stir me most\\nTo my revenge. But in my terms of honour\\nI stand aloof; and will no reconcilement\\nTill by some elder masters of known honour\\nI have a voice and precedent of peace\\nTo keep my name ungor'd. But till that time\\nI do receive your offer'd love like love,\\nAnd will not wrong it.\\n\\nHam.\\nI embrace it freely;\\nAnd will this brother's wager frankly play.--\\nGive us the foils; come on.\\n\\nLaer.\\nCome, one for me.\\n\\nHam.\\nI'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance\\nYour skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,\\nStick fiery off indeed.\\n\\nLaer.\\nYou mock me, sir.\\n\\nHam.\\nNo, by this hand.\\n\\nKing.\\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\\nYou know the wager?\\n\\nHam.\\nVery well, my lord;\\nYour grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.\\n\\nKing.\\nI do not fear it; I have seen you both;\\nBut since he's better'd, we have therefore odds.\\n\\nLaer.\\nThis is too heavy, let me see another.\\n\\nHam.\\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\\n\\n[They prepare to play.]\\n\\nOsr.\\nAy, my good lord.\\n\\nKing.\\nSet me the stoups of wine upon that table,--\\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit,\\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire;\\nThe king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;\\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw,\\nRicher than that which four successive kings\\nIn Denmark's crown have worn.
